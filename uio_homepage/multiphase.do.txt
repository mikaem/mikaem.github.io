===== Multiphase =====

I currently supervise two PhD-students, Tormod Landet and Christopher Friedemann,
that are working on two widely different aspects of two-phase flows. 

Christopher is involved in the "Annulus flow":
"https://www.ife.no/no/ife/ife_nyheter/2017/flerfasestromning-gjennom-firearig-forskerprosjekt"
project headed by "IFE": "https://www.ife.no" and in collaboration with
Imperial College London. The project is sponsored by the Norwegian Research
Council. We use OpenFOAM to simulate and understand two-phase flows in annulus
configurations cite{chris2017}, i.e., flow between an inner and outer pipe. Figure on the right shows annulus flow in an
experimental configuration at IFE.

In Tormod's project we are investigating finite element methods for use with two-phase flows. We
are looking into slope limiting of the velocity field in a discontinuous
Galerkin and divergence free setting. cite{tormod_fenics_2017}
