===== Multiphase =====

I currently supervise two PhD-students, Tormod Landet and Christopher Friedemann,
that are working on two widely different aspects of two-phase flows. 

Christopher is involved in the "Annulus flow":
"https://www.ife.no/no/ife/ife_nyheter/2017/flerfasestromning-gjennom-firearig-forskerprosjekt"
project headed by "IFE": "https://www.ife.no" and in collaboration with
Imperial College London. The project is sponsored by the Norwegian Research
Council. We use OpenFOAM to simulate and understand two-phase flows in annulus
configurations. cite{chris2017}

In Tormod's project we are investigating finite element methods for use with two-phase flows. We
are looking into slope limiting of the velocity field in a discontinuous
Galerkin and divergence free setting. cite{tormod_fenics_2017}
