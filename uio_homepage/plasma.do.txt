===== 4DSpace =====

In the strategic research initiative "4DSpace":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/" we study
instabilities and turbulence in the polar ionosphere with an integrated, multi-scale 4D (3D in space and time) experimental, theoretical, and modelling approach.

Two of my PhD students *Diako Darian* and "Sigvald Marholm":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/?vrtx=person-view&uid=sigvaldm" are both
working under the 4DSpace umbrella, that alltogether count approximately 40
people. We are focusing on developing unstructured Particle In Cell (PIC) codes with finite
element and Lagrangian particle methods, within the FEniCS framework. See Marholm et al. 
cite{marholm2018}.

In the paper by Darian et al. cite{diako_2017} we use PIC simulations of a sounding rocket in
ionospheric plasma to investigate effects of magnetic field on the wake formation and rocket potential. In the paper by Miloch et al. cite{Miloch2018} we study dynamic ion shadows behind finite-sized objects in collisionless magnetized plasma flows.

Darian and Mortensen cite{darian2015pseudo} have implemented a spectral MagnetoHydroDynamics
solver with the Boussinesq approximation for variable densities within the
"spectralDNS": "https://github.com/spectralDNS" framework, and use it to study
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified and unstratified shear layers. 

Miloch, Darian and Mortensen cite{wojciech2017} study the wake potential of a
dust particle in magnetised plasmas.
