===== Research =====

I started my research career studying mixing sensitive reactions in turbulent
flows, which quickly led me to mathematical models for non-premixed turbulent
combustion. Since then I have become more and more interested in Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and scientific computing. And since turbulence, CFD and scientific
computing enter into a wide range of different research fields, my research
topics may seem to be all over the place:-) 

I am involved with plasma physics and
rocket science through the "4DSpace":
"http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/" research
initiative at the University of Oslo, where we study instabilities and
turbulence in the polar ionosphere. "See more": "plasma.html". 

I have been working as an "adjunct research scientist": "https://www.simula.no/people/mikaelmo" at "Simula":
"https://www.simula.no". Here I worked mostly at the "Center for Biomedical Computing":
"https://cbc.simula.no/pub/" using "FEniCS": "https://www.fenicsproject.org" to
study biomedical flows. "See more": "biomedical.html".      

My preoccupation with turbulence and scientific computing has spiked an
interest in spectral methods, that often are used in state-of-the-art
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) codes for turbulent fluid flows. Combined with
my interest in Python as an efficient tool for high-performance computing, this
has led to the "spectralDNS": "https://github.com/spectralDNS" project. "See more": "spectralDNS.html".

I currently supervise two PhD-students, Tormod Landet and Christopher Friedemann,
that are working on two-phase flows. "See more": "multiphase.html"
