Associate Professor Mikael Mortensen received his PhD in mathematical modeling
of turbulent reactive flows from "Chalmers University of Technology":
"http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx", Sweden in 2005. He then worked for one year
as a Post-Doctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney, in the world
leading research group of Prof. Robert W. Bilger at the "School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic
Engineering": "http://web.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/index.php". While in Sydney he
worked mainly with developing mathematical models for spray combustion, and
turbulent mixing of flows with multiple injections. Returning to Norway,
he worked with turbulence modelling and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for five years at the "Norwegian Defence Research Establishment":
"https://www.ffi.no", before
landing his current position as Associate Professor at the "University of Oslo":
"http://www.uio.no", Norway.

Dr. Mortensen is interested in CFD and the many aspects of turbulent fluid
flows, ranging from physics, modeling, numerical methods, software implementation and applications. 
And since such topics as turbulence, CFD and scientific computing are relevant
for a wide range of
different research fields, his later research topics venture into fields
such as plasma physics, biomedical flows, multiphase and numerical analysis. 
In recent years he has been working extensively with finite element (FEniCS) and spectral codes for Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulence, with codes preferably written in the high-level Python language.
