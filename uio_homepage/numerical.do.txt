===== Numerical methods =====

My (now finished) PhD student Miroslav Kuchta has been looking at numerical methods to solve
saddle point systems arising from trace constraints coupling 2D and 1D domains,
or 3D and 1D domains cite{kuchta2016} cite{kuchta2016preconditioning} cite{kuchta15}. 

We have also been studying the singular Neumann problem of linear elasticity
cite{kuchta2016singular}.
Four different formulations of the problem have been analyzed and mesh independent preconditioners established for the resulting linear systems within the framework of operator preconditioning. We have proposed a preconditioner for the (singular) mixed formulation of linear elasticity, that is robust with respect to the material parameters. Using an orthonormal basis of the space of rigid motions, discrete projection operators have been derived and employed in a modification to the conjugate gradients method to ensure optimal error convergence of the solution.
