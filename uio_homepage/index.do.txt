Welcome to my homepage! I work as an Associate Professor in Fluid Mechanics at the "Department of
Mathematics, University of Oslo": "http://mn.uio.no/math". My primary interests
are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the many aspects of turbulent fluid
flows, ranging from physics, modeling, numerical methods, 
software implementation and applications. I spend part of my time within the
"4DSpace": "http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/4dspace/"
strategic research initiative, where we study instabilities and turbulence in
the polar ionosphere. I am also a Python enthusiast and I use this language as
often as possible in teaching and scientific computing.
