===== Biomedical flows =====

I have been working as an "adjunct research scientist": "http://www.simula.no/people/mikaelmo" at "Simula Research Laboratory":
"http://www.simula.no". Here I had the great honor to be working with the late
"Prof. Hans Petter Langtangen": "https://hplgit.com/homepage"
(cite{Valen-Sendstad2011}, cite{Mortensen2016}, cite{Mortensen2012_transitional}, cite{mortensen_2011_awr}), 
at the "Center for Biomedical Computing":
"http://cbc.simula.no/pub/". 

I have contributed quite a bit to the "FEniCS":
"https://www.fenicsproject.org" project, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver "Oasis":
"https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis" has been developed within the FEniCS framework. The solver has been developed for
efficiency and it has been found to scale well up to 256 processors on the
"Abel": "http://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/abel/"
supercomputer. The solver is written entirely in Python, and we
have shown that it may run as fast and accurate as the low-level finite volume
C++ solvers OpenFOAM and CDP (Stanford). The Oasis solver is documented in the
*Computer Physics Communications paper*
cite{mortensen2015oasis}.

The Oasis solver has been used in a range of master theses (see "Teaching":
"teaching.html#sec:master"),
and one of these, for my student Per Thomas Haga, led to a paper on injecting
drugs in the Cerebrospinal fluid cite{haga_2017}. The animation on the right
show how the injected drug moves up and down inside the CSF channel. It can also
be sen that, due to the very low diffusivity of the scalar drug, we modelled the
scalar transport using Lagrangian particle tracking.

I have been working quite a bit together with "Kristian Valen-Sendstad":
"https://www.simula.no/people/kvs" at Simula, on different aspects of biomedical
flows. Our simulations on intracranial aneurysms
cite{Valen-Sendstad2011}, actually reached the headlines of Norway's larges
newspaper (VG), when we found a correlation between transition
to turbulence and the risk of aneurysm rupture (more famously known as stroke).
For this work I performed most of the simulations when still at "FFI":
"https://www.ffi.no".
