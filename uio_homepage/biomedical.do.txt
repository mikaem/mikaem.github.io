I have been working from 2012-2016 as an "adjunct research scientist": "http://www.simula.no/people/mikaelmo" at "Simula Research Laboratory":
"http://www.simula.no". Here I had the great honor to be working with the late
"Prof. Hans Petter Langtangen": "https://hplgit.com/homepage"
(cite{Valen-Sendstad2011}, cite{Mortensen2016}, cite{Mortensen2012_transitional}, cite{mortensen_2011_awr}),
at the "Center for Biomedical Computing":
"http://cbc.simula.no/pub/".

I have contributed quite a bit to the "FEniCS":
"https://www.fenicsproject.org" project, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes solver "Oasis":
"https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis" has been developed within the FEniCS framework. The solver has been developed for
efficiency, with MPI, and it is written entirely in Python. The Oasis solver is documented in the
*Computer Physics Communications paper*
cite{mortensen2015oasis}, where we
<img src="figs/scalar_anim.gif" align="right" width=400 style="margin: 5px 5px 5px 10px;">
show that it may run as fast and accurate as the low-level finite volume
C++ solvers OpenFOAM and CDP (Stanford).

The Oasis solver has been used in a range of master theses (see "Teaching":
"teaching.html#sec:master").
For one of my master students, Per Thomas Haga, the thesis led to a journal paper on injecting
drugs in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cite{haga_2017}. The animation on the right
shows how an injected drug moves up and down inside the CSF channel. It can also
be sen that, due to the very low diffusivity of the scalar drug, we modelled the
scalar transport using Lagrangian particle tracking.

I have been working quite a bit together with "Kristian Valen-Sendstad":
"https://www.simula.no/people/kvs" at Simula, on different aspects of biomedical
flows. Our simulations on intracranial aneurysms
cite{Valen-Sendstad2011}, actually reached the headlines of Norway's larges
newspaper (VG) ref{vg}, when we found a correlation between transition
to turbulence and the risk of aneurysm rupture (more famously known as stroke).
For this work I performed most of the simulations when still at "FFI":
"https://www.ffi.no".

More recently we have been studying transition and
mesh sensitivity in the FDA nozzle benchmark. In cite{Bergersen2018}
we use both regular CFD and linear stability analysis to show that care must be
taken when designing a CFD benchmark. Transition to turbulence can only
come from a seed, or perturbation, and an ideal case like the FDA
benchmark should not transtition at all unless some noise is added to the
system. Figure ref{lsa} is showing an unstable eigenmode in the FDA
bechmark, showing that transition should in deed occur at the Reynolds
number=3500. Here I have conducted the stability simulations using the
"dog":"http://users.monash.edu.au/~bburn/semtex.html" linear stability
analysis software package.
