The *uio_homepage* folder contains source files for my homepage at https://folk.uio.no/mikaem

The homepage is created using [doconce](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce). The HTML theme is modified from the following 
[template](https://github.com/hplgit/hplgit.github.com/blob/master/homepage/template_solarized_box_yellow.html), which is based on the [DocOnce solarized box template](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce/tree/master/bundled/html_styles/style_solarized_box), which is again a modification
of the web pages by [Prof. Peter Haschke](http://www.peterhaschke.com) (under a Creative Commons [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)).
